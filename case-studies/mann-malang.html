    <p>Mann Malang is a non-profit community for people with intersex variation to provide resources and foster
        connections. The objective was to create a PWA to help users (that are intersex people or connected to intersex
        people) have access to resources that can provide them with help and necessary information. The goal is to also
        let the users connect with like minded people and build a community.</p>

                <p>People from the Intersex community often find it hard to find help or resources or even people
                    who may be facing the same challenges as them in the world. Even caretakers (such as parents,
                    siblings, etc.) of intersex people need access to helpful resources and to other people in
                    similar situations as themselves.</p>

                <p>To create a platform which can offer resources, insights and a place to foster community and
                    rewarding relationships. This community would be for people that identify as intersex as well as
                    people that are connected to them.</p>

        <h4>The Strategy</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The client came to me already having an idea of what they wanted to create, which was a PWA. This would be
        beneficial in India as it was a product that had to reach as many people as possible and the primary device to
        access the internet in India is a smartphone1, 2. A desktop version of the PWA would also be created for the
        minority who have access to desktops/laptops.</p>
    <p>This cemented our decision to follow a mobile first design strategy.3, 4</p>
    <p>Having worked with communities on the ground with their target audience, they already had a bank of research on
        the users. It was my job to bring their ideas to life.</p>

<section class="container p-0 mt-4" id="user-personas">
    <div class="row justify-content-start">
        <h4>User Personas</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The first step was to sift through the user data that was collected by the clients and understand the
        frustrations and motivations of the users. I aggregated the vast data and created 5 personas, consisting of
        people with intersex variation, caretakers of intersex people and researchers/activists.</p>

<section class="container p-0 mt-4" id="user-flows">
    <div class="row justify-content-start">
        <h4>User Flows</h4>
    </div>
    <p>After creating the user personas, a very thorough site map and user flow was made.</p>
    <p>The client already had a clear idea of what functionalities they wanted to include in the product. These
        functionalities included:</p>
    <p>After listing out the functionalities a site map was created to figure out a clear navigation for the user. The
        challenge was to keep the navigation as simple as possible, considering how many different sections were there
        in the product. The product was split into two main sections, what you could see when signed in and when signed
        out. The idea being that even if someone didnâ€™t want to interact with the community, they would still have
        access to helpful information from blogs, articles, webinars and videos.</p>
